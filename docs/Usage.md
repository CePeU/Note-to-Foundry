## Usage

### Variant 1:
1. Use the notetofoundry Icon on the left side in the Obsidian panel. This will use the last active profile (in the settings or chosen by variant 2)

### Variant 2:
1. Open the context menu (right click) 
2. Select the profile to use for your export. A default profile and a Foundry VTT profile are supplied. You can make your own profiles.

### Variant 3:
1. Open the command palette (default is `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`) and search for **"notetofoundry"**.
2. Select **Copy selection or document to clipboard** to save your current selection, or if nothing is selected, the full file to the clipboard.

# General information how the plugin works

The plugin cleans the exported HTML from all clutter that Obsidian uses in its rendered HTML. So in effect you have to tell the plugin what you want
to KEEP.
Keep that in mind if you modify attributes or classes because you then need to exclude them explicitly from being removed!

Currently the plugin works in the following order:
1) Convert images - convert image paths in HTML or convert to base64. Base64 encoding will overwrite any picture path links with the base64 encoded picture.  
   For Foundry export you therefore need to disable Base64 encoding unless you want to copy and paste into Foundry VTT from the clipboard! (But ProseMirror
   is partly bugged in that regard - again my personal view - see explanations later)
3) Resolve internal links - resolve links in HTML to full internal links
4) Replace HTML tags - replace one tag with the other tag (or even with nothing). It uses query selector syntax to do that. Make sure you use it correctly!
5) Remove empty container - removes empty p and div nodes/containers which hold no inner content
6) Remove Frontmatter - removes frontmatter header of the HTML
7) Remove attributes - removes classes and attributes and keep only those specified

Up to this point a HTML node view was manipulated! After these steps an HTML string/text is manipulated.

7) Replace strings in the HTML (text) document with regex rules. Make sure they are correct!
8) Use your own JavaScript code to manipulate the HTML. (see details below in settings description)
9) If needed add a header and footer part to the HTML. It is your responsibility what is added and how that fits into the HTML structure!

## Plugin settings documentation
>[!IMPORTANT]
>You need to install configure three things for full Foundry VTT functionality! 

 A)  You need to install this plugin in Obsidian. This will give you HTML export and the ability to potentially push the HTML to Foundry VTT  
 
 B)  You need to install a relay server or make an account with an open relay server which will be the communication hub between the 
     notetofoundry Obsidian plugin and the REST Foundry module. Installing the relay server locally will allow you to use an unlimited amount
     of rest calls once you set the environment variable FREE_API_REQUESTS_LIMIT (so adjust your docker-compose.yml with this line FREE_API_REQUESTS_LIMIT= 999999).    
     [ThreeHats/foundryvtt-rest-api-relay](https://github.com/ThreeHats/foundryvtt-rest-api-relay) or use [https://foundryvtt-rest-api-relay.fly.dev](https://foundryvtt-rest-api-relay.fly.dev)        
     
 C)  You need to install the Foundry REST module.       
     (ThreeHats/foundryvtt-rest-api: A Foundry VTT module that provides a general purpose REST API through a WebSocket relay (https://github.com/ThreeHats/foundryvtt-rest-api)       

>[!IMPORTANT]
> For first steps and probably most reliable functionality you should be logged in as a user into your foundry instance.
> You might get an error if you go inactive and the timeout to the relay server triggers.
> In that case reload your foundry session and try again.
> There is also a functionality to let the plugin login headless into a selected foundry instance but it is much slower and not well tested yet.

- **Actions**:
  - Switch between enabling debug output or not.

  Debug output can be seen if you press ctrl+shift+i in your Browser. Then select "Console" in the menu.
  On the right side beside "Filter" select "All levels" and enable "Verbose". This will show all console.debug output messages.
  notetofoundry messages begin with "M2F: ... some .. text"

## Profile Management

### Active Profile
- **Description**: Select the active profile to be used for export.
- **Actions**:
  - Switch between profiles using a dropdown menu.
  - Save the selected profile as the active profile.
  
Shows the active profile which will be used. If you press the FoundryToMarkdown button in the sidebar this
is the profile which will be used.
Includes a default profile. If you get confused you can reset to some tried and meaningful standard settings
for HTML export.

### Existing Profiles
- **Description**: Manage existing profiles.
- **Actions**:
  - Add a new profile.
  - Remove an existing profile.

You can add new profiles or remove profiles here. To remove a profile just use the X on the profile tag.
A default profile and a Foundry export profile which will export a callout with the "secret" metadata as a   
secret into Foundry VTT are included.

### Clone Profile
- **Description**: Create a new profile by cloning the settings of the current profile.
- **Actions**:
  - Enter a name for the new profile.
  - Clone the current profile.

If you want to slightly modify a profile without inputing everything you can clone a profile.
Input a new name and the currently active profile will be cloned.

***

## Clipboard export settings

### Clipboard Export
- **Description**: Export the HTML to the clipboard.
- **Default**: Enabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

You can define if a copy of the overworked HTML is pasted to the clipboard or not.   
This is especially helpfull if you are developing a new export profile as you can see what will
be delivered to Foundry VTT. Also this allows for copy and paste into other applications like
for example Bookstack.

### Header and footers for clipboard export
- **Description**: Add custom text or HTML to the header and footer of the exported HTML.
- **Actions**:
- Add or edit header and footer content.

You can add any text you like as header and footer to the output html text. Make sure it makes sense!

## HTML file export settings

### Header and footers for HTML file export
- **Description**: Add custom text or HTML to the header and footer of the exported HTML.
- **Actions**:
- Add or edit header and footer content.

You can add any text you like as header and footer to the output html text. Make sure it makes sense!
(For file export you thus can add style.css and a body tag).   

**EXAMPLE:**   
A reoccuring question has been how GM informations can be hidden if you use HTML export in Obsidian.
With this plugin it is easy :) just add:
`<style>.secret { display: none }</style>`   
To the header of your HTML file export.

If your players are too tech savy and you need to remove the information then use tag replacement.

### File Export
- **Description**: Export the HTML to a file.
- **Default**: Disabled.
- **Actions**:
  - Enable or disable file export.
  - Specify the file path for export.

You can give a Windows path to export your html to. Make sure the path is correct!   
(TODO: Test for Linux and and make file path operations OS-safe)

### Dirty Export
- **Description**: Export HTML without removing classes or attributes.
- **Default**: Disabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

This setting is one of the interesting ones. It allows for a dirty export of your HTML.
No changes will be made and you will see exactly what Obsidian exports. This is very helpful
to analyze the HTML and being able to create rules to clean the HTML to your own needs.

***

## Attributes and Classes

### Attributes to Keep
- **Description**: Add attribute names you want to keep when rendering Markdown to HTML.
- **Default**: `["id", "href", "src", "width", "height", "alt", "colspan", "rowspan"]`
- **Actions**:
  - Add new attributes.
  - Reset attributes to default.
  
You can specify which attributes will NOT be cleaned from the HTML (see step 6)

### Reset attributes
- A button to reset attributes to keep to a standard settings

***
## Classes

### Classes to Keep
- **Description**: Add class names you want to keep when rendering Markdown to HTML.
- **Default**: Empty list.
- **Actions**:
  - Add new classes.
  - Reset classes to an empty list.

You can specify which classes will NOT be cleaned from the HTML (see step 6)

### Reset classes to keep
- A button to reset which classes shall be keept

***

## Rule-Based Replacements

### HTML Tag Replacement
- **Description**: Set up rules to replace HTML tags during export.
- **Example**: Replace `<div>` with `<p>`.

You can specify which tags are replaced or changed and what rule to use. Also the order of the rules applied
is set. The plugin uses query selector syntax.   

#### Example:
An Obsidian callout of this type ">[!secret]+ Some Secret GM Stuff" needs to be made into a secret in Foundry VTT.   
The dirty HTML ouput is something like this:   
`<div ... data-callout="secret"...> ... </div>`   
For Foundry VTT we need a "section" tag instead of a div tag. So we change the tag.  

The rule fields are filled with:   
**Field1:** div[data-callout="secret"]     
**Field2:** section   

We use the query selector div[data-callout="secret"] which will trigger on every div with an attribute data-callout="secret"
and change each div which matches to a "section" tag.   
The output result will be something like this:   
`<section ... data-callout="secret"...> ... </section>`    

Keep in mind we only changed the tag! The attributes remain!

### Regex Replacement Rules
- **Description**: Add regex rules to modify the HTML during export.
- **Example**: Use regex to replace specific patterns in the HTML.

You can specify what regex rules are applied and in which order.  

#### Example:
Remember that our tag has now been changed to a section tag but the attributes and classes remain?   
Some other tags have also changed during the tag replacement according to the rules set there.   
We now have an output like this:   
`<section ... data-callout="secret"...class="callout"> <summary><span> Some Secret GM Stuff</span></summary>...</section>`    
This output would be a nice foldable details structure if not for the section tags.   
In fact this is how a callout which is not of type secret is exported.   
It would look like this:   
`<details ... data-callout="secret"...class="callout"> <summary><span> Some Secret GM stuff</span></summary>...</details>`   

But for our usecase we need a section with a class="secret" and an id with a random uuid conforming to Foundry requirements.   
It should look like this in the end:   
`<section class="secret" id="xxxxxxxxxxxx"> Secret Text here </section>`   

So the next step is to grab the correct HTML tag and classes and rewrite them. This is allready done as   
a string operation on the HTML text and not as a node parsing. So we input the following Regex expression:   

**Field1:**   
`<section[^>]*data-callout="secret"[^>]*class="callout"[^>]*>\s*<summary>(.*?)<\/summary>/g`

and the desired replacement   

**Field2:** `<section  class="secret">`   

The result will be something like this:   
`<section  class="secret"><summary>Some secret GM stuff</summary></section>`   

### Javascript Replacements
- **Description**: Add custom JavaScript functions to modify the HTML during export.
- **Example**: Use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML string.

You can write Javascript code to manipulate the HTML. The HTML is supplied as a variable named "html".
For Foundry export a function to generate a foundry compliant ID (api.createID) is also exposed. You need to end your
function with "return 'variable holding the html string' " to return the modified HTML.

#### Exposed functions:
- api.createId():    generates a 16 character long random ID that can be used as a identifier for Foundry (secrets for example)
- api.frontMatter(): exposes the frontmatter of the current note which is processed during HTML cleaning

#### Example:  
(which will replace all exported classes="secret" which are my callouts for GM stuff with the "secret" class of Foundry and give it an id)

const newHtml = html.replace(/class="secret"/g, function(match) {  
  const newId = api.createID();  
  return \`class="secret" id="secret-${newId}"\`;  
});  
return newHtml  

This will replace all classes="secret" texts with classes="secret" id="xxxxxxxxx" and generate the desired HTML:   
`<section  class="secret" id="xxxxxxxxxx"><summary> Some secret GM stuff</summar></section>`  

If you want you can improve by also cleaning out the summary tags during a second and third step.
***

## Detailed Export Rules

### Wikilink Resolution
- **Description**: Resolve internal Obsidian wikilinks and export them with the Obsidian vault path.
- **Default**: Disabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

This resolves internal Obsidian wikilinks to full sized path links.
IMPORTANT: Only limited tests have been conducted with (full) links inside of Obsidian. Only Obsidian like (short) wikilinks have
been tested.

### Image Encoding
- **Description**: Encode images as Base64 in the exported HTML.
- **Default**: Enabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

Encodes embedded images to Base64. You can then copy and paste directly into other applications like for example Bookstack. 
Be aware that ProseMirror in Foundry is in my personal opinion potentially bugged and developers seem to see that as a 
"feature". Reports about strange sanitizing of HTML tags have been flagged as not to be implemented. ProseMirror still remains
behind in HTML abilities to TinyMCE after all these years and in addition does weird things to HTML. Also it does not seem
there is really any drive to develop a good HTML editor alternative as this issue/idea is open for 4 years now. 

See my report: [Prose Mirror still stripping HTML wrongly and sanitizing too much � Issue #13167 � foundryvtt/foundryvtt](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/13167)

One has to concede that the developers might be right in that regard as there probably is no need as there do not seem to be enough community bug reports about
journal handling else there would be a bigger need to fix those issues or patreon votes would be different.

#### So here are some observations/bugs and tips:
- Use the TinyMCE editor if you want to copy and past directly from clipboard!
- Opening journals with ProseMirror which work with TinyMCE might lead to sanitizing and breaking your journal
- Do not use "id" attributes in tags you want to do an inner anchor link to
- Do not place any base64 encoded pictures between span elements
- Be careful with span elements as they seem to be arbitrarily sanitized
- Font tags are problematic/useless (but I can understand that up to a point)
- asof 26.09.2025 Foundry V13 has a bug in using nested secrets

- .... to be continued
  
### Remove Frontmatter
- **Description**: Remove frontmatter from the exported HTML.
- **Default**: Enabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

Removes the frontmatter from the html. I do not know who would like to use and have it in their HTML BUT
they can if they like!

***

## Foundry Export Settings

### Header and footers for clipboard export
- **Description**: Add custom text or HTML to the header and footer of the exported HTML.
- **Actions**:
- Add or edit header and footer content.

You can add any text you like as header and footer to the output html text. Make sure it makes sense!
(For Foundry you thus can wrap the whole export in a div with a special class and bind your css to that)   

### Foundry Export
- **Description**: Export the HTML to Foundry VTT via a REST call.
- **Default**: Disabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

This will give the ability to export the html to Foundry VTT as a journal entry.
You need to install the foundry REST module from ThreeHats and set up a relay server or use
the one which ThreeHats supplies (currently free of charge but bandwidth costs money!).

1) Foundry REST Module:    
   [ThreeHats/foundryvtt-rest-api: A Foundry VTT module that provides a general purpose REST API through a WebSocket relay](https://github.com/ThreeHats/foundryvtt-rest-api)
3) Relay Server:    
   [ThreeHats/foundryvtt-rest-api-relay](https://github.com/ThreeHats/foundryvtt-rest-api-relay) or use [https://foundryvtt-rest-api-relay.fly.dev](https://foundryvtt-rest-api-relay.fly.dev)

### API Key
- **Description**: API key for Foundry VTT export.
- **Default**: Empty.
- **Input**: Enter the API key.

You need an API key for the relay server. The API key is like your password so the Foundry instance
authorizes against the relay server and this plugin does so also. You get the API key
from the Foundry VTT RELAY once you made an account. Then you need to input that API key into your Foundry module AND the Obsidian Plugin!  

### Relay Server
- **Description**: IP or URL of the relay server for Foundry VTT.
- **Default**: `https://foundryvtt-rest-api-relay.fly.dev`
- **Input**: Enter the relay server address.

This defines the relay server to use. ThreeHats is so generous to supply a public one. You can also set
up your own. Be aware that the relay server only handles requests with a payload of a maximum of 250 MB!!!
So please do not try to upload journals with pictures/maps bigger than 250 MB! Also use compression on your pictures!
Be reminded again bandwidth costs money.

### Foundry Session ID
- **Description**: Specify the Foundry world ID for export.
- **Default**: First active world is used if no ID is specified. This can lead to random results.
- **Input**: Enter the Foundry session ID.

Each Foundry session has a unique ID which is derived from the server, the world and the user logged in.
You can get this information from the Foundry module or with the helper button of the plugin.

### Helper to get Foundry Session ID
 **Description**: This button press will do a call against the relay server and list all connected instances.
- **Default**: First active world is used if no ID is specified. This can lead to random results.
- **Input**: Choose one session ID from the dropdown

This button is to help you determine which session IDs are available. If you have only one Foundry instance
running you will only see one session ID. Also your Foundry installed Foundry module needs to be ACTIVE!
After some time even an active Foundry instance will drop the connection to the relay server! This is intended!
This means the best and safest way to get your session ID is to log in to your Foundry instance(s) and then press
this button to get your session ID(s). You then can select the desired one with the dropdown.

## Foundry journal relinking export settings

### Copy Foundry VTT journal linking macro to clipboard
- **Description**: This will copy the journal linking macro to your clipboard only.
- **Actions**:
  - Copies macro to clipboard.


### Install Foundry VTT Journal Linking Macro
- **Description**: Install the linking macro to your Foundry session.
- **Actions**:
  - Uploads and installs the macro in Foundry.

You need to have an active session to install the macro. Ideally you are logged in! 
By pressing this button a connection is established to your active foundry session and a relinking macro is installed. 
The macro will allow you to relink imported Obsidian journals. Any journals/pages not found will stay visible as "normal" hyperlink in the journal.
Just import your next journal/page and use the macro to link both journals/pages.

(Example how this works and what advantages an Obsidian UUID has)


### Foundry VTT Journal Linking After Every Export
- **Description**: Automatically run a journal linking process after each export.
- **Default**: Disabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

Instead of using a macro you can let the plugin execute code on your Foundry instance to relink journals
after each import.

***

## Foundry Headless Login Settings

### Foundry Headless Login
- **Description**: Allows connecting and exporting notes without being logged into Foundry.
- **Default**: Disabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

If all goes well (needs deeper testing) this will allow Obsidian to connect to your specified
Foundry session without you being logged in. This is slower because of the login process and
probably will only make sense much later IF a batch export can be done.

### Foundry Server IP
- **Description**: Set the IP/URL and port of the Foundry server.
- **Input**: Enter the server IP/URL.

### Foundry User
- **Description**: Set the username for login.
- **Input**: Enter the username.

### Foundry User Password
- **Description**: Set the password for the user.
- **Input**: Enter the password.

### Foundry World
- **Description**: Set the world name to log into.
- **Input**: Enter the world name.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The world name needs to be the unique name you gave the world during creation.
>You can use the "worldTitle" which the helper button will show or the "customName"
>which you applied in your Foundry module.

***

## Foundry Standard Export Settings

Here you can set default settings where notes and pictures will be exported to. If you choose frontmatter usage
the exported page ID and all other settings will be written back into the frontmatter of your note!
You can then change the frontmatter in the note (or do that right away from the start). Frontmatter information
will overwrite standard settings. If no settings are found the plugin will default to a standard journal called
"ObsdianExport" in the root folder.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Do NOT use file path slashes at the beginning or end of your paths in this settings!    
> DO: assets/pictures    
> DO NOT DO!!: /assets/pictures or assets/pictures/  

### Set Foundry standard export settings
- **Description**: Allows to set standard export settings for Foundry export
- Default: Disabled

### Header and footers for Foundry HTML export
- **Description**: Add custom text or HTML to the header and footer of the exported HTML.
- **Actions**:
- Add or edit header and footer content.

You can add any text you like as header and footer to the output html text. Make sure it makes sense!
(For Foundry export you could add a div and classes to bind your css to)  

### Foundry Folder
- **Description**: Set the default Foundry VTT export folder.
- **Input**: Enter the folder name.

### Foundry Journal
- **Description**: Set the default Foundry VTT export journal.
- **Input**: Enter the journal name.

### Foundry Picture Path
- **Description**: Set the default Foundry VTT picture export path.
- **Input**: Enter the picture path.

***

## Frontmatter Settings and Usage

notetofoundry has a set of Frontmatter entries you can use to define informations on a on note level. These entries will override more  
general settings.  

The frontmatter properties are:

**UUID:** A Foundry stly UUID consisting of 16 alphanumeric entries
**VTT_Folder:** The export folder to export the note to
**VTT_Journal:** The export journal to export the note to
**VTT_PageTitle:** The page name in the journal entry to use for this note (you can use this to not use the notes filename)


### Obsidian frontmatter UID
- **Description**: Write an UUID into the Obsidian note when it is first exported.
- **Default**: Disabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

It will give your obsidian note an UUID which can be used by the plugin to find the Obsidian note and the corresponding Foundry note regardless if the Obsidian note has been moved.

### Foundry writeback options
- **Description**: Use frontmatter for export settings and write back Foundry information into Obsidian pages.
- **Default**: Disabled.
- **Toggle**: Enable or disable this feature.

This will write information about your exported note to the Obsidian note frontmatter. 


#### How this works:
The plugin exports additional meta information with your export (Foundry flags). Each page/note will receive informations about
where it comes from. The unique information in obsidian is the file location. No location can hold two notes of the same name. 
As long as name or location do not change the note/page can be uniquely identified and thus linked to other obsidian notes which have been exported.
If your note changes name or file location it becomes a "new" note. If that is not desired you can write frontmatter information which
will create a (statistically) unique Obsidian UUID, store it in your note as frontmatter and export it to foundry as a unique identifier.
During relinking of notes the plugin will relink based on Obsidian UUID first and then based on name and file location.

VTT_xxx frontmatter settings are foundry specific information.
The plugin will try to find the correct note for relinking but using an UUID should make updates, and relinking more stable.
Be aware that changing the frontmatter after your first import (like for example changing the folder) will reimport your
note as a NEW entry in Foundry and set a new Foundry VTT_UUID.
You will then have two Journals with the same Obsidian UUID in Foundry. If a relinking takes place any not yet relinked note linking
to those two notes will be a randomly linked to the first (internally) found note with this obsidian UUID. So you need to do a delete
before a relink run.
(planned: way to relink such already linked notes to the correct remaining note if only one remains after deleting the unwanted note)

**To make it clear:**
The plugin does NOT search Foundry, checks if an Obsidian note with an Obsidian UUID exists allready and does adjustments to update the Foundry note
according to these informations! The source of truth is Obsidian! Folders and Journal destinations AND the name of the Note determine if a
note will be exported or updated. Of course this also determines the destination where it will be created/updated in Foundry.
So far the Obsidian UUID is for relinking notes correctly even if the location and name of the note in Foundry change. This can thus still
lead to two Foundry pages having the same Obsidian UUID if they are exported twice to different locations in Foundry (Folder/Journal)

***

## Other Functions

### Templater
The plugin allows for calling a function to generate a 16 character id which will work with foundry.
The id to call this is "createfoundryId" or you us CTRL+P and use notetofoundryVTT: generate foundry ID. You can use this function with templater to create the Obsidian UUID during usage of templater.  
You can also use it to generate a secretID if you need it for any reason.
(TODO: make a templater example)
